# It's time to get down to business.

It's time to understand on how we can **connect**, **read** data, and then **transfer** data onto an an *ecosystem*.

We're gonna be looking at a service known as **Azure Synapse**. Now **Azure Synapse** can be used to `connect` onto your **data stores** like `Azure Data Lakes`, we will be having your data in `Azure Data Lake`.

1. You might need to connect onto the `data stores`. We can make use of external **tables** to **read data** off of `Azure Data Lake`.

      </kbd>
      

2. We can also **host** a `SQL data warehouse` with the help of `Azure Synapse`. So we're gonna look at something known as a **dedicated SQL pool** that can be used to **host** a `SQL data warehouse`.

    </kbd>
    
    
3. We can also **transfer** data from one location onto another. We can transfer it onto `Azure Synapse` with the help of an **integration feature** of `pipelines`.

There's a lot that we need to cover.  So let's get ready and go onto the section when we learn all about working with `Azure Synapse` as a **server**.
